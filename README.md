# Harvard 24' Data Science Final Project

The file allegations_202007271729.csv contains records about closed cases for every police officer on the NYPD force as of late June 2020 who had at least one substantiated allegation against them, spanning from September 1985 to January 2020. Information on the variables in this dataset can be found in CCRB Data Layout Table.xlsx. This data was downloaded from Kaggle and originally reported on by ProPublica. Your goal is to recommend a model to predict the disposition ruled by the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) and identify key variables that appear to be associated with the board’s ruling.

The most influential factor for the disposition ruled by the CCRB is the year the complaint was received, with complaints filed in recent years, particularly after 2015, being more likely to be substantiated. This trend reflects not just improvements in investigative processes but also increased public awareness of laws and regulations, as well as heightened societal attention to police accountability. Therefore, enhancing the legal awareness of law enforcement officers through continuous education and training is crucial to ensure they keep pace with evolving laws and societal expectations, thereby improving accountability and the substantiation of complaints over time. The outcome of the contact between the officer and complainant description category further plays an important role in disposition. To be specific, serious incidents, such as violent arrests or physical confrontations, are more likely to be substantiated. To improve the handling of serious incidents such as violent arrests or physical confrontations, stakeholders should implement more rigorous and comprehensive de-escalation training for officers, ensuring they are equipped with effective conflict resolution skills to prevent such incidents from escalating. Both the specific nature of the allegation and its classification under Force, Abuse of authority, Discourtesy, or Offensive language (FADO) are highly predictive of outcomes. The CCRB should prioritize regular reviews and updates to the policies governing these categories, ensuring clear guidelines and accountability measures are in place to handle such complaints effectively. Given the observed geographic patterns where certain precincts, such as those in Brooklyn, experience higher substantiation rates, it is recommended that the NYPD conduct targeted audits and enhanced training initiatives in these areas to address specific local issues and ensure consistent application of policies across all precincts. The ethnicity of complainants and the gender of the officer involved also influence complaint outcomes. Higher substantiation rates among complaints are from Black and Hispanic individuals and against male officers. While this may reflect systemic patterns, it is essential to monitor these trends to ensure fairness and transparency in complaint investigations.

To improve the analysis and outcome prediction, it would be better to divide the focus into three distinct parts: information about the officers, the complaints, and the public’s perception. Officer Perception: Incorporating officer tenure, measured as the number of years an officer has served in the NYPD, could provide insights into whether experience or time on the force influences the likelihood of complaints being substantiated. Analyzing an officer’s complaint history, including the total number of prior complaints and how many were substantiated, can help identify officers with recurring issues and inform targeted interventions. Understanding the type of evidence presented during the CCRB review processsuch as video footage, photographs, or other physical evidence could reveal its impact on complaint outcomes. Complaint Perception: Examining patterns of repeat complainants, specifically whether individuals have filed multiple complaints against the police in the past, could highlight unresolved tensions within certain communities or raise credibility concerns. Public Perception: The information on public response to the incident collected through surveys, could provide valuable insights into public trust and the overall effectiveness of the CCRB’s processes.
